# Rental Price Outlier Analysis

This notebook is a presentation of the analysis of the work that our software and data engineers were able to implement into one of our real estate websites in Brazil. 

- In this project I read in all the rental data files.
- Preprocessed the data to ensure we had no duplications or missing values that wil skew the analysis.
- Imputated data for various columns and cleaned out unecessary values
- Categorised the data more effectively

Exploration:
- I made sure to understand the distribution of the prices for each category.
- I determined where the outliers lay in the dataset and calculated statistics
- Presented the data in histograms

Conclusion:
- At the end I provided a conclusion of the analysis and recommendations
